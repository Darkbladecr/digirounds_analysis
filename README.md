This Quality Improvement project looks at improving the efficiency of ward rounds over a three week period, and compares the use of different devices over each week:

1. Laptop
2. iPad
3. Laptop + iPad

The notebooks provide insight as to how you would use pandas to better understand correlations between variables and test hypotheses with statistical tests.

There is a number of plotting libraries used to explore the different ways of coding graphs.
